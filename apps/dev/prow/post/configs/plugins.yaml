  # ExcludeApprovers controls whether approvers are considered to be

  # insufficient reviewers are available. If ExcludeApprovers is true,

  # MaxReviewerCount is the maximum number of reviewers to request
  # reviews from. Defaults to 0 meaning no limit.

  # reviews from. Defaults to requesting reviews from 2 reviewers
  request_count: 2

  # UseStatusAvailability controls whether blunderbuss will consider GitHub's
  # status availability when requesting reviews for users. This will use at one
  # additional token per successful reviewer (and potentially more depending on
  # how many busy reviewers it had to pass over).
